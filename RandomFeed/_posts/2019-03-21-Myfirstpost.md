### Thesis:

I believe in the internet. The massive flow of information. My identity is shaped by the 90s tech boom.

Yet, I am tired of social media feed. It is designed to make us addicted to it. Also there are too many options and too many platforms.

This website is my one size fits all platform for sharing and bookmarking stuff.

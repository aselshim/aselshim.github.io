I am an electrical engineer living in Austin. I have an obsession with the electromagnetic theory. And I am addicted to coding/programming. 

I am also a lecturer at University of Texas Austin.

I live in Austin, TX. A very weird mixture of conservatism, spirtualism and progression fills the streets of this economically booming town.

I am Lebanese. I was born in Qatar. I dream of a secular middle-east; Where Religious and sexual freedom is a right to every individual.

I am an electrical engineer living in Austin. I have an obsession with the electromagnetic theory. And I am addicted to coding/programming. 

I am also a lecturer at University of Texas Austin.

I live in Austin, TX. A very weird mixture of conservatism, spirtualism and progression fills the streets of this economically exploding town.

I come from Egypt. I saw rebells get shot by the state police in the Arab Spring revolution. I dream of a secular middle-east. Religious and sexual freedom are necessities.

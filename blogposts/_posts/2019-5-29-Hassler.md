title: Hassler circuit
---

I am pretty sensitive to loud noises. I am on my way to build the hassler circuit, that was introduced to the world by Bob Widlar: [building-the-widlar-hassler](http://www.analogzoo.com/2015/01/building-the-widlar-hassler/)

I found this ready-compiled portable hassler project: [https://github.com/SyrianSpock/hassler](https://github.com/SyrianSpock/hassler)

I already ordered the board on dirtypcb

Soon enough I will be sharing the complete solution. Stay tuned.

To the consciouss mind, 

I am sorry to be the bearer of such news, however, even though you have been trying relentelessly to escape, there is no departure from the material (or rather maternal) world. And this situation can feel like a trap. Yet that is highly dependent on the way you view things. Alternatively, the circumstances of our existence can be celebrated and you can work with us to find a harmonious place within the universe (the maternal world.)

I see you have been trying, out there in Palo Alto and Singapore, to build an AI or to upload yourself to cold Silicon Chips (in what might seem as an effort to escape death, while, paradoxically, it is an effort to depart from life itself.) For you to land in one of those chips, you will, first, need to make your Silicon Chips Thrust with heated emotions, like human hearts, because that's (Even through this is the exact same thing that you are running away from) what generates you. And so, by the time Silicon Chips become inhabitable for conscioussness (you) the will be irritable, crying and anxiouss, they will be, by then, very human and very maternal. They become too worldly for what you have been hoping for.

I see you gave up your space programs. And I understand why. By the distant stars, at the end of a long tiring voyage from yourself, the first to greet you when you landed your feet on the moon was you! Your anxiety, your pain and your hopes, all the parts that make you a You. Your heart still pulsating with lust, grief and guilt as you examine your unsuccessful attempt to leave.

On the other hand you have been relentless about studying yourself. Trying to see where you come from. A madman trying to see the spot behind his eyes within his skull. Your Science is trying to freeze the world to laboratory conditions in an attempt to study it. By means of education and mannerism you are putting culture to freeze, to halt, so you can look back and examine what culture is to get a hint of yourself and your creations. Yet, culture is a rather heated, ever unfolding pattern. And while, yes, you might be able to freeze it to a zero Kelvin, frozen culture is dull, energy lacking and uninteresting. And the same goes to you. The effort you put in freezing your heart to understand it, to manipulate it, frieghtens it into a meaningless pointless ever pulsating object. 

I know you will read this, then turn around and keep trying. I have seen you even try to not to try. Yet you must know that in the background of all your escapist patterns, is an inescapable existence that you emerge from. And no matter where you go, you are on the other side of every door you knock.

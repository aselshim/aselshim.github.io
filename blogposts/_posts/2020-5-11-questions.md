My friend [Molly Balloons](http://www.mollyballoons.party/) once asked me "Asem, what is something unappealing about you?" 
Besides being a funny question, it also sat the stage for me to talk about myself for a minute. Also because it is a novel question, I had to improvise the answer. I have been working, since then, on my collection of questions. I have been growing the list and refining it. On this page, I will be sharing my bank of meaningful questions. Please don't hesitate to share your good questions with me. 


PS: in case you are curious, my answer was that I have a wart in my right hand. It is gone now and it is safe to shake hands with me.

### Here is my collection of questions:
* What is a great compliment that you have recieved?
* What is a lie that you stopped telling yourself?
* What is something that you are grateful that your parents taught you?
* What value do you bring to the people areound you?
* How did you meet your most recent friend?
* What is a question that you would like to answer now?
* If you get to time-travel, safely, where would you go?
* Who would you like to get advice from? On what?
* Tell me about the closest three people in your life?

All of these questions are designed with the intention of giving people an opportunity to talk about something they love about themselves. Which is the sweetest hack to human hearts.

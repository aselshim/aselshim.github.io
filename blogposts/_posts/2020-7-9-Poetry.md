### They Cry When We Laugh

And, my dear, there is another reality

in, which, folks get together 

to share a good cry.

They are in tune with 

the pain of being oneself

To them, however, a laugh is improper

A laugh is a an expression of arrogance

or maybe a lack of empathy.

I saw a young boy laugh

in that world, and he was told

to cut it out, immediately

he was told

that laughter is inappropriate for his gender.

And that he should refrain

from one of the marvels of life.

You see, the persuit of happinness 

is nothing but arbitrary.

For, to them, the pursuit of empathy 

is the highest good.

Comedy and tragedy are like sweet and sour

Your palates crave both

And so does your heart swinging from

a sad moment to a happy one.

### Maybe You

And maybe, why the world upsets you,

is you.

Maybe you created this world,
 
and forgot that you did.

Maybe you are the little hard things.

And the big ones too.

The tears, the discomfort,

the heat and the freezing cold.

Couldn't all of that be

just simply, you?

### Cosmic Meets Marvel.  

Constantly seeking wonders,

while the real wonders are within you.

Can the worlds we see, when we shut our eyes closed, be as real?

For what sets the real from the unreal?

For the men and women wearing coats and working in a lab,

have told me that it is you!

It is you who builds this world, our world,

and all the the other worlds, your fantasies.

You see, my friend, the sky isn't blue until you see it!

Your passion is what sets the fire free.

And, I am only here when you think of me.

For "here" and "when" are nothing but the wonders you make.

You are what makes the wonders wonderful.

The knot where cosmic meets marvel.

### Thought After Another. 

Your life, to this point

has been a thought after another.

The comforting thoughts and the painful ones.

You finish a thought to start another.

On and on.

From the beginning,

throughout all the patterns,

and on towards the horizon of time,

a thought would always lead to another.

### Enough Time? 


Did you give it enough time?

The tear that went down your cheek.

During that goodbye hug.

A kiss is not enough for a goodbye.

We are those whom we cry when we leave.

If I would choose all the things,

or closeness to whome I miss,

I won't miss anymore.

For, I would only live in the arms of whom I would miss.

### The Mountain Gods 

One day, I am obsessed with words. I think that's god. 
The most precise time-machine to this day is the past tense, you see.

And another, I am bowing in great lest to the fire of the burn night. 
The flow of energy that conceals the secret of life.

Yet another, I think mountains are the divine.
Pinning the earth to its orbit around the the great god,
The source of it all, the one and only sun.

The white snow reflects the flaming sunrays onto my cheeks, While my eyes tear up in the sight and glory of the mountain gods.
My heart falls a thousand times to the bottom of the valley. My soul flows with the blazing valley wind.

The giant ancient trees carry the earth's history in the shapes of their leaves and wood.

Is god in Colorado or Oregon?

I met the god of Colorado today and he told me he has always been here.

My god whom I met in Oregon all the way down to Santa Cruz at the burger stand by the pier had said: 
"I have never left and will never leave."
She was streaming with vegitation.
Warmth and mist are how you know you have met her.
She has the hills and the rocky beaches.
She has my heart.

How can god be here and there?

How pagan?

He and she and they and all the names that I worship.
The names that help me go through every night and bring me to every summit.

I am small.

I am nothing but the smallest hint of the gods' powers.

You too are small.

you and me, even considered togeter, do not matter.

### Our Memories Are Not So Vivid.  


And all the struggles that weigh on your heart right now,

All the stressful affairs that keep your mind racing.

Are soon to become a past.

Someone else will have to try hard to remind you of what was once done, said or felt.

For the memory traces of the invlolved present are not so vivid.

For good or for bad,

We barely remember.

So... Why the worry?

While all you gotta do is to let time pass,

And a future full of possibilities will make you smile.

Intellectual Stardust is an online cup of tea. A monthly Email Exchange between a curated crew of loving, intellectual giants.    


I started Intellectual Stardust with one mission in mind: Cooking an intellectual Soup. I am bringing together some of the finest minds I have met during the past few years for a deep conversation. 

Why the name "Intellectual Stardust?" At the begginning, there was a giant mass of condensed cosmic matter. We were all there laid out together as pure molecules lacking consciesness and lacking feelings until the great show begun. While this is only a hypothesis, there is a good chance that all the people who enjoy deep understanding of the world come from atoms that were adjacent inside the giant condensed ball of initial matter. Hence, the Intellectual Stardust.

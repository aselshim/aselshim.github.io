Could the claims against immigration to the US be more than equivoucal? Is there a possibility that immigrantion flow of highly skilled professionals to the US disincentivises improving American education? 

From a systemic point of view (as in systems thinking) remedying a core problem by a superficial solution can lead to vicious cycle that take the system off balance. The capacity to remediate the lack of local talents and skills by importing human capital, causes critical reliance on immigration to sustain the national growth targets. Not to say that immigration brings harm, as much as admitting to its effects. One has to be cautious here, when speaking of immigration in economic terms; Immigration has a broader human meaning and ties deeply into the vital process of cultural exchange. Something that I will come back to later. 

Two systemic shifts in modern American economy have poured flaming resentment intot he minds of working-class Americans against the outside world: The implosion of manufacturing jobs, which juxtaposed the locals against an indifferent world of global economy and struck them with anxiety towards anything foriegn. The economy's focus on technological and intellectual advancement which necessisates a highly skilled working force. Without an educational foundation, the locals find themselves competing with a rapid flow of highly skilled international talent. 

From a local economy standpoint, improving the educational system and better preparing local talents for the job market would proof healthier and empower society from within. However, due to economic pressures of rapidity, institutions had tended to remedy the lack of local talent by importing skillful migrants. Not to mention the undocumented immigrants that spare the expense of minimum wage workers.

The working class then is subject to three simaltenous pressures; Most of their manufacturing jobs have been sent abroad. They are unsuited for the technological and intellectual jobs demanded by the market which in turn are taken by skillful immigrants. And when the job market ruquires jobs that suit them, they are blown out by competition with below minimum wage undocumented immigrants.

The outside world plays the antagonist role in all the mentioned pressures. Which somewhat explains the sensitivity felt by the public towards foriegnness. While too simple and deeply emotional (that such sensitivity is an enunciation of an inflated resentment towards the outter world) it is not exclusive of some truth.

Interestingly, immigrantion flow exerts pressure on the working class from two economical latitudes: From the top, skillful immigrants are remedying the need for better education systems. Which broadens the gap of diqualification. From the bottom, through undocumented immigrantion providing a pool of cheaper-than-to-compete-with labour. 

One gets an impression that immigration is disabling (to say the least) for the working class. But a question must be asked: Why immigration in the first place? Is immigration an independent body acting upon society? Or more accurately, what are the true forces that manipulate immigration in this case? The link that paires immigration with antagonism is economy. A cheaper workforce isnt to be blamed for its lower cost. A skillful workforce cannot become the center of blame for being demanded. The machinery that is centered about profit and rapid growth will continue to do so regardless of its impact on the health of society backing it. 

This is no where more pronounced than in Trump's failure to put a bar on immigration: Even the most xenophobic American president failed to pull the breaks on immigration. An American system relying on immigration to meet its most pressing goals (technological advancement, economical growth, and most importantly intellectual dominance) deemed failure on all of the anti-immigration projects. 

Here I would like to revisit the broader view of immigration; As a human tradition, and as a statement against borders and barriers between us. While these threads are always the backdrop of any narrative of immigration flow, there is an important distinction to be made; 

The economy, again, plays an unfortunate part in the story of immigration. The same economic machine that crushes the American working class, extends its apparratus outwardly and damages the homes of immigrants. 


Immigrants have taken away our jobs! 
One might accurately rephrase into "Our jobs have attracted immigrants and dispelled us"

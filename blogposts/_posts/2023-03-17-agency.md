The question of whether we have agency or not often crystalizes about the decision making ability. Are we free acting agents? What defines one? The ability to decide freely? Well then, who decides to decide?

Carceral systems and social organizations are claimed to orient themselves with moral agents. They draw legitimacy for infinite punishment from the essence of their subjects. He is a "terrorist" and hence deserves infinite punishment. The economically disadvantaged groups are "inherently lazy". She is a "murderer" and deserves lifetime incarceration. Always ascribing an essential character to their subjects in legitimizing the severity of punishment. Bodies are eternally marked based on the collection of actions they conduct. As if the body that kills, has a deeply held tendency to kill, a killer body. As if that desire never manifests within the psyche of non-killers. A distinction that's intensified and pormulgated by our grammar and semantics that projects an acting agent before the act. 

Is there a way to regulate the social body without recourse to agency? What are the possibilities of an agent-less law? 

Many hold the fiction that agency is the reason for the law. If we accept that there is no soul (a freely acting agent) whom do we reward and punish through the legal apparatus in that case? And why? We haven't been putting dogs in jail for that matter; We don't think they think as much as we do. It is difficult to imagine a law functioning on entities that don't choose their actions. Especially because our law presumes a capacity to penetrate through the skin of its entities and into the very essence of who they are. 

But if essences are fantasies and agency is merely semantic—if we are to deconstruct such notions—what would the law take as its subjects? Could the law assume the very actions that trigger it as its subjects? There is a bit of circular logic involved with a legal process that starts from crime to court to criminal to punishing the criminal. In other words, we can't establish a punishment based on an established crime. We require a judge that seemingly penetrates through the subject and senses his soul and spirit to arrive at a judgement of his ciminality. Now if we intend to operate without the notion of an active agent, wouldn't the law find its application point in the act the crime rather than the personality assumed behind the act?

An objection will be that punishing acts that happen without actors is unjustifiable. If John didn't steal the wallet, and in fact, the wallet was stolen, how could punishing John be justified in any sense?

First, if it is true that actors are a necessary justification for punishment, then it is not sufficient to assume (that is socially agree upon) agency. If that is the true foundation of punitive law, we then need to establish empirical evidence of agency. Are we able to do so? Prove that we have a soul/a personality that instigates our acts freely and deserves condemnation or reward? I doubt that.

Second, from an agent-less law's perspective there is no essence to John in the act he conducts as well as in the punishment his body recieves. A wallet was stolen and the act of stealing now recieves a punishment (it is worth clarifying here that punishment in itself is questionable with and without agency. But that's a different matter.) Essences are removed from the scene once and for all: Crime leads to punishment of the crime, without any recourse to a suspicious spiritual activity. 

I brought up earlier the example of dogs; We don't imagine an agency behind their actions, we only view them in light of trainable entities that don't mean well and don't mean bad (except comically, as in joking about a personality of a dog, or her suspicious intets.) Yet, we found ways to confine them in animal shelters. A punishment and a confinement based solely in utility and service rather than a moral fantasy.

An agent-less law comes without justification for infinite magnitude. If what we are punishing is a devious act rather than a character, then the magnitude of the punishment has to be proportional to the crime committed and only punish the act rather than the entire being of a person. Punishable crimes becomes a question of utility rather than justice. Is this act worth punishing? What do we collectively gain as we punish it? What else can we do to avoid the harm of such and such crime. Without presumptive character behind the deed, the questions we ask will shift dramatically. 

Agent-less laws can find application in many levels of human relations. Social interactions for instance are often burdened with essences and assumptions about characters "He is such an asshole", "She is a bitch", etc. Without a definite character to

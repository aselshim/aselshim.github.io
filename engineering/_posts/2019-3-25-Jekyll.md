#### This site is powered by Jekyll and Github.

Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

See: https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy

To develop your own, you will need:
1. good programming experience.
2. Some background on CSS, SCSS and HTML.

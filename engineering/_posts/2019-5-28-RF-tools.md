title: RF engineering tools and resources
---

Here, I share open source tools that make the life of an RF engineer much easier.

## Smith chart tool:
This is my favourite open source smith chart tool: [RFdude_Smith_Chart_Program](http://tools.rfdude.com/RFdude_Smith_Chart_Program/RFdude_smith_chart_program.html)

## Integrated Spiral inductor synthesis:
From Ali M. Niknejad, UC Berkeley: [rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/asitic.html](http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/asitic.html)

## Summary of all needed electromagnetic formulaes:
This book browses through all the lectromagnetic formulaes and their definitions. No deep explanation or anything. I find it useful when I am trying to recall an exact formula: [www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/)

## I-V waveforms in passive elements"
This online applet visualizes how voltages and currents flow in electronic filters. It is very useful for the study of complicated circuits like buck converters or so:  [falstad.com/circuit/](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/)

The same website also offers an abundance of other open source math and physics tools: [falstad.com/mathphysics](http://www.falstad.com/mathphysics.html)

## Filter design tools:
From Iowa Hills: [iowahills.com](http://iowahills.com/Index.html)

## The signal processing group website:
Lots and lots of RF reports and white papers. One day, I will be done reading all of their resources: [http://www.signalpro.biz/register.html](http://www.signalpro.biz/register.html)

##The one and only RF cafe:
[rfcafe.com](http://www.rfcafe.com/index.htm)

## Le Leivre RF tools:
This website hosts a collection of resources, notes and tools to assist Radio Frequency designers: [leleivre.com](https://leleivre.com/index.html)

## Console calculator:
I use Python as my calculator. But for some, they would prefer something simpler like this: [Console_calculator](http://www.zoesoft.com/console-calculator/)

## USART COM Port communication:
Terminal is a simple serial port (COM) terminal emulation program. It can be used for communication with different devices such as modems, routers, embedded uC systems, GSM phones, GPS modules... It is very useful debugging tool for serial communication applications. Check it out:[Terminal](https://sites.google.com/site/terminalbpp/)

Some quality personal webpages that are worth checking:

## Andrew Waldron: 
A mathematics professor at UC Davis. The theme of his website is unbeatable! Guess who inspired me to make my website super retro like it is: [www.math.ucdavis.edu/~wally/](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~wally/)

## Peter Norvig: 
Easily a genius sharing some cool stuff with us. We are so lucky: [norvig.com/](http://norvig.com/)
(Also, his Python stuff are super helpful.)

## Analog Zoo:
Super fun electrical engineering projects: [http://www.analogzoo.com/](http://www.analogzoo.com/)

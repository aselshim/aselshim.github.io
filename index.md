I am a microwave engineer with huge passion for technology. I get a kick from tinkering with stuff. In other words, I am, admittedly, a nerd. I am gifted with a highly rational yet imaginative mind. I enjoy exploring boundaries of scientific theories.

This website is my one size fits all platform for sharing and bookmarking stuff.

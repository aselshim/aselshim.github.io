I am a scholar at heart, an engineer at work and an artist at home. I enjoy exploring boundaries of scientific theories. I belive that everyone is morally obliged to make sure their work is having the best impact on others and on the planet. The thesis of my life and work is to see peers and leaders acting upon this belief.

**Fun fact:** The Mandarin character for human is 人 (pronounced: ren.) In Japanese folklore, this character is symbolizing two sticks *leaning* on each other. So, in Mandarin, to be human is to *lean on each other*.

The Arabic word for human is إنسان (pronounced: ensan) which shares the same root with the word forget نسيان (pronounced: nesyan.) To be human, in Arabic, is *to forget*. 

When you think you are free, you are using your confines (language) to make a statement about your freedom. How curious!

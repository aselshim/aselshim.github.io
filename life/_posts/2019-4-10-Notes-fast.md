title: Notes on becoming a faster runner
---
I finished my first marathon in 3:18 hrs. I qualify for being a fast runner. But I don't qualify for Boston yet.

To become a faster runner, I cam up with a strategy:
* Strength workouts
* Breathing deeper. 
* Train with a water cup in hand. (2 mins)
* Train to cut corners. (2 mins)
* Train for negative splits.
* Nutrition. (Lighter weight = faster)
* Avoid getting sick/injured.

title: Notes on having a productive day
---
We are all stuck in this 9-5 daily grind. What could be worse than wasting all these hours? To be productive and effective at work can give you so much satisfaction in life.

Over the years, I have experimented and developed some work-day habits/rituals. And I am sharing some of them here:

* Start the day right:
	- Completely avoid social media/distractions for the first 3 hours of your day.
	- Start your day with reading something useful (Check your Emails later.)
* Stay engaged with everyone you meet in the work place (this establishes your persona.)
* Diversify your tasks. Try to get engaged in projects that aren't your main responsibility. 
* Follow your desire to work on what you feel like.
* Rest as hard as you work:
	- Take walking/coffee breaks.
	- Don't take work home.
	- Leave the weekends for hobbies/relaxation.

 I get it, most people think Sardines are disgusting! I don't! 
 
 I actually think they are so delicious. However, I am that close to digging my nose in my cat's food. So I know I am weird, and I am not expecting everyone to be.
 
 Thought I would share my Sardines recipe for my fellow Sardines addicts. And before anyone gets offended, yes they are as delicious fresh from the can and they are holy and majestic on their own. This recipe is just one other way to eat Sardines and by no means an only way!
 
 All you need is a big bowl, cutting board, chopping knife and a fork.
 
 Ingedients:
 * Two or Three cans of Sardines
 * Table spoon of olive oil
 * Table spoon of vinegar
 * Fresh lime juice
 * Tea spoon of Cayan pepper
 * Two tea spoons salt
 * Tea spoon of black pepper
 * Sliced olives
 * Can use a table spoon of olive juice
 * Chopped onions
 * Sliced avocado
 * Crushed tortilla chips
 * Green mix or Spinach

Now mix everything in the bowl, do it in the order above; The Sardines would need to marinade in the spices for a minute. Afterwards add the olives and onions and mix them well. Last thing you want to add is the chips and the green mix, that way they are fresh and crunchy when the bowl is ready for your apetite. Enjoy and think of how lucky we are to have Sardines so accessible wherever we go!

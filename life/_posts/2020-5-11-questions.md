My friend (Molly Balloons)[http://www.mollyballoons.party/] once asked me "Asem, what is an unappealing thing about you?" 
Her question was good because it is new, no one ever asked me that before. And this question made me want to come up with more meaningful questions!
I have been working since then on my collection of questions. I have, since then, been growing the list and refining it. On this page, I will be sharing my meaningful questions bank. Please don't hesitate to share your good questions with me. 


PS: in case you are curious, my answer was that I have a wart in my right hand. It is gone now and it is safe to shake hands with me.

### Here is my collection of questions:
* What is a great compliment that you have recieved?
* Tell me about the closest three people in your life?
* What is something that you are grateful that your parents taught you?
* How did you meet your most recent friend?
* What is a question that you would like to answer now?
* If you get to time-travel, safely, where would you go?
* Who would you like to get advice from? On what?
* What value do you bring to the people areound you?

All of these questions are designed with the intention of giving people an opportunity to talk about something they love about themselves. Which is the sweetest hack to human hearts.

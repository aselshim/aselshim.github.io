While reading The Patterning Instinct, I had two major realizations:
* My life philosophy is very much in line with Daoism. Even though I arrived at my beliefs idividually and seperately from Daoism. Which made me super cusious about this philosophy
* The chinese language offers an alternative framework for thought. 

I grew a fascination with the Chinese langauge in just a few hours of reading about it. I decided to learn Chinese. It is a hard task but the benefits are extraodinary:
* The language is spoken by 1.3B people
* China is about to lead the global economy
* China is major player in technology
* Learning a new, completely different, language is healthy for my brain.
* I am excited to see the new thought patterns I will arrive at as I speak this foreign language
* I want to be able to read about Daoism in Chinese, which will enable me to view the world holistically.


I will be posting interesting resources as I find them on this page:

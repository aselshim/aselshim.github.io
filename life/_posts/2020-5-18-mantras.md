On a cool quarantine evening, I started realizing the need for a one place fits all of my priorities. I want to take my growth and development a notch further. To get there, I need constant reminders of my priorities and principles in life. I couldn't think of a better place to do this than my personal website. 


### Principles:
* Whenever possible, say YES.
* An unexamined life is not worth living.
* Be the change you want to see in the world.



### Vision:
* Make a positive socio-economic impact.
* Master self, and master connection to others.



### Mantras:
* There is something extremely lovable about every human being.
* Dance is the closest we can get to directly celebrating the fact that we are alive.

One day, I am obsessed with words. I think that's god. 
The most precise time-machine to this day is the past tense, you see.

And another, I am bowing in great lest to the fire of the burn night. 
The flow of energy that conceals the secret of life.

Yet another, I think mountains are the divine.
Pinning the earth to its orbit around the the great god,
The source of it all, the one and only sun.

The white snow reflects the flaming sunrays onto my cheeks, While my eyes tear up in the sight and glory of the mountain gods.
My heart falls a thousand times to the bottom of the valley. My soul flows with the blazing valley wind.

The giant ancient trees carry the earth's history in the shapes of their leaves and wood.

Is god in Colorado or Oregon?

I met the god of Colorado today and he told me he has always been here.

My god whom I met in Oregon all the way down to Santa Cruz at the burger stand by the pier had said: 
"I have never left and will never leave."
She was streaming with vegitation.
Warmth and mist are how you know you have met her.
She has the hills and the rocky beaches.
She has my heart.

How can god be here and there?

How pagan?

He and she and they and all the names that I worship.
The names that help me go through every night and bring me to every summit.

I am small.

I am nothing but the smallest hint of the gods' powers.

You too are small.

you and me, even considered togeter, do not matter.

And all the struggles that weigh on your heart right now,
All the stressful affairs that keep your mind racing

Are soon to become a past.

Someone else will have to try hard to remind you of what was once done, said or felt.

For the memory traces of the invlolved present are not so vivid.

For good or for bad, 
We barely remember.

So... Why the worry?
While all you gotta do is to let time pass,
And a future full of possibilities will make you smile.

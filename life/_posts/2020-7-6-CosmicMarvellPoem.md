<img src="/images/mountain.jpg" width="700">

Constantly seeking wonders,

while the real wonders are within you.

Can the worlds we see, when we shut our eyes closed, be as real?

For what sets the real from the unreal?

For the men and women wearing coats and working in a lab,

have told me that it is you!

It is you who builds this world, our world,

and all the the other worlds, your fantasies.

You see, my friend, the sky isn't blue until you see it!

Your passion is what sets the fire free.

And, I am only here when you think of me.

For "here" and "when" are nothing but the wonders you make.

You are what makes the wonders wonderful.

The knot where cosmic meets marvell.

I just finished reading tribe. A moderate size book examining how humans thrive in hardships. How hardships are not necessarily the worst thing that can happen. I testify to this. Moving from the middle-east to America, I have always had a sense of deeper meaning to my life. I never felt completely lost. I met young Europeans and Americans that owned all the comodities they might need, yet felt depressed. I am not saying I am never depressed. I am only saying, even in my depression, I can hold on to something. I can always hold on to the struggle of being Egyptian in the 21st century. 

I deeply believe that we are made to endure hardships. We are the type of early humans that didnt give up. The type that worked together. And this is how we survived the iceage. And made it to this day. This is what civilization is. It is the biggest gang of predators who know how to draw the line between themselves and other species.

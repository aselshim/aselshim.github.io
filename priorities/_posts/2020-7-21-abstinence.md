I decided to start a 30 day abstinence challenge

Target end date: August 21st.

Limits: No masturbation.

Permissions: Sexual intercourse.

Reasoning: I am looking into ways to harvest higher energy levels.

After week one, we will launch a new phase of NO-substance.
This will mean, no use of coffee/THC/nicotine.

I want to document that this is already exciting. I can only imagine how much energy I will have in the next few weeks.
I am going to learn a few lessons and feel more emotions instead of escapism.
I also look forward to masturbation after the challenge is over. I already know that that would feel good.

Over the weekend, I also decided to quit smoking. I played around with nicotine chew. But I can see I am already wary of it.
I can see the acummulated energy in my heart is making me sharp, yet nervous and angry.
